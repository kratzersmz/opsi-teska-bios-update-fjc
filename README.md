## How to get the latest Bios Update
If you get the nag screen on Fujitsu Laptops with non admin user, perfect start. If you are logged in as admin user, please logout
* Click next in Bios Battery Nag screen Window
* Then Software tries to connect to the internet and download the latest Bios, good so far
* Now the Software asks for Admin rights. At this point, open task manager and check where the temporary Path of Bios Update actually lies.
* in that path you'll find all software we need for opsi. Should be some ifu.exe + *.bin and some Bios Update file

If you are lazy, just rename the files like the ones in the package....
